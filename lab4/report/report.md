# Laboratoire 4 - TREFLE
## Romain Claret & Edward Ransome

## Introduction
In this lab, we will use three datasets (Cancer, BCWD, GOLUB) and apply various fuzzy logic models to them using the Trefl library.
## Dataset cancer
### Question 1
The train/test seperation is done using a 66/33 split for all datasets.

We can see that there are more data points of class 0 than of class 1 (twice as many) but they are well distributed in the train/test split (the training set is always twice as large as the test set for both classes).
