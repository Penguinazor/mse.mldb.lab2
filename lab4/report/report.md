## Introduction
hello
## Question 1
The train/test seperation is done using a 66/33 split for all datasets.
### Part 0
We can see that there are more data points of class 0 than of class 1 (twice as many) but they are well distributed in the train/test split (the training set is always twice as large as the test set for both classes).
