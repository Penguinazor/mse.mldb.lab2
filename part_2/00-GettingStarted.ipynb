    "This procedure has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 (and 18.04) 64 bits. You may adapt certain commands for your system. Otherwise, install an Ubuntu 16.04 64 bits virtual machine.\n",

    "We are going to install the requirements for this lab. First we need to setup a Python virtual environment which allows us to isolate the installation of the Python libraries for our lab only and not interfering with the ones that are globally installed on the system. Therefore, it ensures that all of the people that use this lab have the same versions installed\n",

If your lab requires additional dependencies, please add a INSTRUCTIONS.md file in your folder with the instructions to install them. Don't forget to add the additional dependencies at the end of your requirements.txt file (or do a pip freeze > requirements_personal.txt command).\n",
